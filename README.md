# Nocalhost

Nocalhost Is Cloud Native Development Environment.

The term Nocalhost originated from No localhost.

Its vision is that in the cloud era, developers use remote cloud native development environments to complete development instead of configuring developing, debugging and testing environments on local computers.

You can use Nocalhost to:

- deploy complex microservice applications to cloud environment.
- develop components(services) quickly with prepared configuration.
- share development environment within teams. 
- fasten the feedback loop of "coding-building-running--debugging-testing".


## Why we make Nocalhost?

As microservices become more and more popular and the number of microservices increases, `containerization` technology becomes a good solution to standardize the runtime environment.

Kubernetes is a typical microservice runtime solution. But developers who build application based on Kubernetes are facing problems. Such as:


- In order to develop a certain microservice, it is necessary to start the entire environment and all microservices, which requires high performance of local resources, poor experience and high cost;
- Developers often only focus on the services they are responsible for. With the continuous iteration of services and configurations, it is more and more difficult for the machine to start the `new` and `complete` development environment;
- Every time the code changes, the process of build image -> push image -> pull image -> restart application (Pod) is required, the feedback loop of development is extremely slow;
- When two or more developers are involved in remote collaboration and joint debugging, they need a flatten network(VPN is too complicated to configure).

## How to resolve？

Based on Kubernetes, Nocalhost provides sevral features:
* Quickly create an application development environment based on Kubernetes Namespace isolation for each team member, which promise development and debugging will not affect each other;
* Cloud native experience microservice development and debugging: No needs to start any microservices on local machine. Any code changes will be synchronized immediately to the remote Pod without rebuilding images.
* Starting services orderly. Such as: "Mysql (UP & Init) -> RabbitMQ (UP) -> Server A (UP) —> Server B (UP)"

# Nocalhost components

## Nocalhost Server

- Nocalhost Api
- Nocalhost Web

Nocalhost Server manages applications, clusters, users and authorizations.

## Nocalhost Dep

Nocalhost Dep is a Agent running in Kubernetes which controls the starting order of services.

## nhctl

nhctl is a command line tools running locally. It controls status of applications and services.

## IDE Plugin

Nocalhost focus on developer, we provide IDE Plugins to connect Cloud and IDE directly.

- Visual Studio Code Extension
- IntelliJ Plugin(Planning)
